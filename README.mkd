## Teaching Kids Programming

The goal of this document is to collect resources for teaching kids programming.

There are many attempts to provide structure for kids who want to learn programming, but my experience is that there generally isn't a good curriculum to send someone who wants to teach a child how to program.

The core issue, I believe, is that almost all of these resources progress through concepts too quickly.

This document aims to:

1. Be a resource for someone who desires to teach kids (or anyone, really) programming
2. To serve as a reference of prior art in preparation for a new curriculum
